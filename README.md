===========

Hi, You might be wondering where this repository is ?!

We just wanted to inform you that we are no longer hosting our code on Github and have moved on to another hosting space.

If you have a forked version of this repository on Github, it would be nice if you could delete it in order to avoid any orphan forks lying around.

In case you are interested in contributing to this project, please let us know.

BTW, in case you want to try the plugin, you can access it here: http://beamos.arkene.com

Cheers!
